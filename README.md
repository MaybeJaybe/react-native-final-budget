# Class - Final Project

I made a basic budgeting app to track expenses.

## Description 

This final project is a place where you can show your knowledge of the material and concepts covered in class. It's also a place where you can express your ideas in code and bring those ideas to life. 

### Why this assignment?

Revisiting the concepts is the best way to solidify your understanding. Taking the ideas from class and putting them together on your is the best way to prove your mastery of a topic. 

## Project requirements

This will be a project of your design. You will decide the topic, content, and platform. Your project can be anything you like but needs to include the following: 

- Tab View Navigation with at least three tabs
- FlatList or SectionList 
- Uses Redux to manage application state

In addition, you need to scope your project to be able to complete it by the end of the term. 

Here are a few places you might look for ideas for your final project: 

- Could be a continuation of an earlier project like an intensive project. 
- Could be a mobile application that acts as a frontend or client for an existing backend or service project. 
- it could be one of the tutorial projects converted to React Native

### Deliverable

Your final project should be on GitHub and submitted to GradeScope.
